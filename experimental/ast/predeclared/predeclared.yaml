- name: Name
  type: byte
  docs: |
    Name is one of the built-in Protobuf names. These represent particular
    paths whose meaning the language overrides to mean something other than
    a relative path with that name.
  methods:
  - kind: string
  - kind: go-string
  - kind: from-string
    name: Lookup
    docs: |
      Lookup looks up a predefined identifier by name.

      If name does not name a predefined identifier, returns [Unknown].
