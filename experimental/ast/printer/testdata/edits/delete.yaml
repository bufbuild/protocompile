# Tests for deletion behavior:
# - Basic message deletion
# - Field deletion from message
# - Detached comments (separated by blank line) are preserved
# - Attached comments (no blank line) are deleted with content
# - Trailing comments (same line) are deleted with content
# - EOF comments are preserved when last element is deleted
