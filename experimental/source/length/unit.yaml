- name: Unit
  type: int

    Unit represents units of measurement for the length of a string.

    The most commonly used [Unit] in protocompile is [TermWidth], which
    approximates columns in a terminal emulator. This takes into account the
    Unicode width of runes, and tabstops. The rune A is one column wide, the rune
    貓 is two columns wide, and the multi-rune emoji presentation sequence 🐈‍⬛ is
    also two columns wide.

    Other units of length can be used to cope with the needs of other rendering
    contexts, such as the Language Server Protocol.
  methods:
  - kind: string
