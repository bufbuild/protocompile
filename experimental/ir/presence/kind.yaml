- name: Kind
  type: byte
  docs: |
    Presence represents how a field is present in a message. This generalizes
    cardinality (viz. optional or repeated).
  methods:
  - kind: string
  - kind: go-string
  values:
  - name: Unknown
  - docs: |
      The field is singular and presence is a distinct state; corresponds to
      fields marked as "optional".
    name: Explicit
  - docs: |
      The field is singular and presence is equivalent to the field having its
      zero value. This corresponds to a non-message field not marked "optional"
      in proto3.
    name: Implicit
  - docs: |
      The field is not optional; it is always serialized, and an error is raised
      if it is missing when deserializing.
    name: Required
  - docs: |
      The field is repeated: it can occur multiple times, and semantically
      represents a list of values.
    name: Repeated
  - docs: |
      The field is part of a oneof: it is singular, and its presence is shared
      with the other fields in the oneof (at most one of them can be present
      at a time).

      Notably, oneof members cannot be repeated.
