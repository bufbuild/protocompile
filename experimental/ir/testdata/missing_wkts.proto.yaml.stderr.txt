internal compiler error: could not import `google/protobuf/descriptor.proto`
   = note: protocompile is not configured correctly
   = help: `descriptor.proto` must always be available, since it is required for
           correctly implementing Protobuf's semantics. If you are using
           protocompile as a library, you may be missing a source.WKTs() in your
           source.Opener setup.
