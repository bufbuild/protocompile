⟨b.red⟩error: system not supported⟨reset⟩

⟨b.red⟩error: this diagnostic message is comically long to illustrate message wrapping;
       real diagnostics should probably avoid doing this⟨reset⟩

⟨b.red⟩error: could not open file "foo.proto": os error 2: no such file or directory

⟨blu⟩ --> foo.proto

⟨blu⟩ --> foo.proto
  ⟨blu⟩ = ⟨b.cyn⟩note: ⟨reset⟩this footer is very very very very very very very very very very very
           very very very very very very very long
  ⟨blu⟩ = ⟨b.cyn⟩note: ⟨reset⟩this one is also long, and it's also
           supercalifragilistcexpialidocious, leading to a very early break
  ⟨blu⟩ = ⟨b.cyn⟩help: ⟨reset⟩this help is very long (and triggers the same word-wrapping code
           path)
  ⟨blu⟩ = ⟨b.cyn⟩help: ⟨reset⟩this one contains a newline
           which overrides the default word wrap behavior (but this line is
           wrapped naturally)
  ⟨blu⟩ = ⟨b.red⟩debug: ⟨reset⟩debug lines are never wrapped, no matter how crazy long they are, since they can contain stack traces⟨reset⟩
