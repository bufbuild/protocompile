error: system not supported

error: this diagnostic message is comically long to illustrate message wrapping;
       real diagnostics should probably avoid doing this

error: could not open file "foo.proto": os error 2: no such file or directory
 --> foo.proto

warning: file consists only of the byte `0xaa`
 --> foo.proto
   = note: that means that the file is screaming
   = help: you should delete it to put it out of its misery
   = debug: 0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

remark: very long footers
 --> foo.proto
   = note: this footer is very very very very very very very very very very very
           very very very very very very very long
   = note: this one is also long, and it's also
           supercalifragilistcexpialidocious, leading to a very early break
   = help: this help is very long (and triggers the same word-wrapping code
           path)
   = help: this one contains a newline
           which overrides the default word wrap behavior (but this line is
           wrapped naturally)
   = debug: debug lines are never wrapped, no matter how crazy long they are, since they can contain stack traces
