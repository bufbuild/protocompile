diagnostics:
  - message: "system not supported"
    level: LEVEL_ERROR

  - message: "this diagnostic message is comically long to illustrate message wrapping; real diagnostics should probably avoid doing this"
    level: LEVEL_ERROR

  - message: 'could not open file "foo.proto": os error 2: no such file or directory'
    level: LEVEL_ERROR
    in_file: foo.proto

  - message: "file consists only of the byte `0xaa`"
    level: LEVEL_WARNING
    in_file: foo.proto
    notes: ["that means that the file is screaming"]
    help: ["you should delete it to put it out of its misery"]
    debug: ["0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"]

  - message: "very long footers"
    level: LEVEL_REMARK
    in_file: foo.proto
    notes: 
      - "this footer is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long footer"
      - "this one is also long, and it's also supercalifragilistcexpialidocious, leading to a very early break"
    help:
      - "this help is very long (and triggers the same word-wrapping code path)"
      - "this one contains a newline\nwhich overrides the default word wrap behavior (but this line is wrapped naturally)"
    debug:
      - "debug lines are never wrapped, no matter how crazy long they are, since they can contain stack traces"
