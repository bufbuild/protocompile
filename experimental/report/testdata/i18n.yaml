  # NOTE: This test does not produce correct output because it requires
  # bidi handling. Its primary purpose is to show we get it absolutely
  # wrong. Rust *also* gets this completely wrong, so we're not gonna bother
  # yet, either. https://godbolt.org/z/Eb8eo3fW9

  # That said, here are detailed instructions on how to go about fixing
