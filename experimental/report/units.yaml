- name: LengthUnit
  type: int
  docs: |
    LengthUnit represents units of measurement for the length of a string.

    The most commonly used [LengthUnit] in protocompile is [TermWidth], which
    approximates columns in a terminal emulator. This takes into account the
    Unicode width of runes, and tabstops. The rune A is one column wide, the rune
    Ë≤ì is two columns wide, and the multi-rune emoji presentation sequence üêà‚Äç‚¨õ is
    also two columns wide.

    Other units of length can be used to cope with the needs of other rendering
    contexts, such as the Language Server Protocol.
