    // 1. Truncate text to only include the parts used by the diagnostics, and
    //    include start_offset and start_line to compensate for deleting a
    //    prefix of the file.
    // 2. Add a `repeated Hunk` field that includes whatever hunks of the file
    //    are relevant, so that the file can be reconstructed (and filled with
    //    e.g. nulls to compensate).
    //
    // It is not immediately clear if this optimization is necessary, because
    // source code files are rarely beyond the order of kilobytes in size.
