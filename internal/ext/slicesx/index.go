	// 2. That the subtraction did not overflow. If it did, diff will be
	//    negative two's complement, i.e. the MSB is set, so it will be
	//	  greater than byteLen, which, due to allocation limitations on
	//    every platform ever, cannot be greater than MaxInt, which all
	//	  "negative" uintptrs are greater than.
	//
	// 3. That byteLen is not zero. If it is zero, this branch is taken
	//    regardless of the value of diff
	//
	// 4. That p is not nil. If it is nil, then either diff will be huge
	//    (because s is a nonempty slice) or byteLen will be zero in which case
	//    (3) applies.
	//
	// Doing this as one branch is much faster than checking all four
	// separately; this is a fairly involved strength reduction that not even
	// LLVM can figure out in many cases, nor can Go tip as of 2024-10-28.

	// does not point to the start of one of the slice's elements. However,
	// because the pointer and slice must have the same type, this would mean
	// that such a pointee straddles two elements of the slice, which Go does
	// not permit (such pointers can only be created by abusing the unsafe
	// package).
